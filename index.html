         <h3 class="title">Our Story</h3>
         <div>George is super cool.  Michelle saw him and was like damn.  Now they are getting married.  Neat.</div><br/>
         <div><p>George and Michelle met at a bar in what was once known as the Ballston Mall, and is now a construction pit. While George was walking Scout on a rainy Saturday afternoon, he received a not so unusual
            text invite to grab lunch at the bar. Little did he know, like everywhere else in DC, the bar was filled with people from Michigan (a CMU alumni event in this case, which will be important later). 
            Needing people from a cooler state to make a party, he joined in.  George and his Michigan friends continued partying and mixing with CMU folks all day.
            Meanwhile, Michelle and Colleen (you can read about her in the <a href="#party">wedding party section</a>) 
            had yet to miss a CMU event since moving to DC and so became drawn to the party and some beer pong with George and Jake 
            (you can read about him in the <a href="#party">wedding party section</a>).</p>

           <p> The group continued partying back to Old Town Alexandria where they partook in mystery Jamaican Christmas Liquor from Michelle and Colleen's fridge, danced in bars with sticky floors, and generally got up to no good.
            When George asked for Michelle's number, she happily gave it to him, but was nearly certain she would be ghosted like Casper.  That was not the case and several years later the two would be taking Scout to their new
            apartment in DC.</p>
            
            <p>Last year, for Michelle's birthday, the two took a trip to Richmond, staying at the storied Jefferson Hotel.  Little did Michelle know that George had
               been carrying an engagement ring loose in his pocket for the last several weeks waiting for the right moment.  While relaxing in the pool, George decided it was time
               and asked Michelle if she wanted to marry him.  "Duh".  He slipped a ring on her finger under the water while Michelle struggled to figure out what was happening. 
                "Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up."  
               Now they're getting married, but you know that or you wouldn't be on this website.

               beyond, moving to Virginia together to become teachers. Colleen was there the night that Michelle and George met (see <a href="#story">Our Story</a>) and has been there every step of the way.

               You can currently find them taking a lap at the bar, waking Michelle up with some three AM Iron Maiden, or just generally being excellent.  </div>

               the two continue to have excellent adventures around the world.  Recently, Sam, Jess, George, and Michelle have been seen drinking Ginjinha on the streets of Lisbon and learning to

                  and Michelle nights were build around dancing and the finest vintages of Little Penguin. Although Kara now lives across the country, George and Michelle 
                  have enjoyed visiting her for rainy hikes in the desert and can't wait to visit in Portland!

                        During the early stages of George and Michelle's relationship, Fred blew George's spot, by introducing himself to her by name in the hallway, despite never meeting her before.
                        Scout serves as Fred's professional wardrobe consultant, advising him on which pants should be worn to interviews.   </div>

                     they have continuously been an excellent duo.  After high school, the two parted ways to lead separate but weirdly similar lives.  Now adults, conversations have turned from finding girls and punk rock
                      to software engineering and punk rock. Now, Gaetano returns as part of the wedding party for the two to regress and party once again.

                     <div>Kaitlin and Michelle met when they were teaching at MCS. Kaitlin was the music teacher and Michelle taught Kindergarten. They quickly bonded and Kaitlin is always happy to come out and have fun with Michelle and George be it Halloween, random bar crawls or birthday celebrations.

                  <div>After living together in the Phi Psi fraternity house for several years in Buffalo, Ryan and George 
                     have developed a continuing friendship that can only be forged from hunting rats with BB guns.  As the fraternity fantasy football league's resident comic, Ryan can be found
                     refining his art or busting out impressive dance moves. I'm pretty sure he once held the arcade basketball record at Player's Club.

                        <div>Chelsea and Michelle met shortly before they began Kindergarten. Chelsea and Michelle spent their formative years together in Onsted and
                            have enjoyed many memories throughout the years including the county fair, playing tennis and going off into the big scary world when they 
                            started college.
